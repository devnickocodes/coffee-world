### __User Testing__

After the completion and deployment of the website, I sent a link over to family, friends and colleagues and everyone said it was easy for them to navigate through the website, and also that it was easily readable, some of them checked the website on their phones, some on their tablets and some on their computers and everyone was happy with how the website performed.

### __Cross-browser Testing__

After the deployment of the website I tested it on the three main browsers, Chrome, Edge and Firefox. The website loaded without a problem on every single one of the browsers.

- Chrome
