              <h3>Top 3 Countries that Drink the Most Coffee Per Person</h3>
              <p>
                1. Finland — 12 kg/26 lbs — Finland is the world's biggest
                consumer of coffee on a per-person basis.Coffee is so popular in
                Finland that two 10-minute coffee breaks are legally mandated
                for Finnish workers.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Norway — 9.9 kg/22 lbs — Norwegians drink more than three
                cups of coffee a day. Coffee houses are popular in Norway.
              </p>
              <p>
                3. Iceland — 9 kg/20 lbs — Coffee has long been the most
                essential social drink in the country. It is customary in
                Iceland to offer any visitor a cup of coffee, and Icelanders
                have a stock reply, tíu dropar, or "ten drops," to indicate that
                they just want a small cup.

              <h3>Most expensive coffee in the world!</h3>
              <p>
                Produced in a remote province in northern Thailand, Black Ivory
                Coffee involves minimal machinery, relying instead on the
                natural digestion of elephants.Only the best high-altitude
                Arabica cherries are selected and most are unrecoverable during
                the process. Black Ivory's supply comes down to two factors:
                their appetite and the availability of coffee cherries.Prices
                start from $1000 up to $1500 for half a kg of coffee
              </p>

              <p>
                Kopi Luwak is the world's most exclusive and expensive coffee.
                The reason behind its high price is how it is made. Notably, the
                name Kopi Luwak is not the name of the coffee but the method of
                production. According to their website, the coffee beans are
                chosen and partially digested by the Indonesian palm civet and
                then excreted, this removes the outer layer of the coffee bean
                and they are then thoroughly cleaned, roasted and then
                distributed. Prices range from $150 to $600 for less than half a
                kg

              <h3>Health benefits of coffee!</h3>
              <p>
                1. Caffeine is not only linked to a lower chance of developing
                Parkinson's disease, but it may also help those with the
                condition better control their movements.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Both regular and decaf coffee seem to have a protective
                effect on your liver. Research shows that coffee drinkers are
                more likely to have liver enzyme levels within a healthy range
                than people who don't drink coffee.
              </p>
              <p>
                3. Dark roast coffee decreases breakage in DNA strands, which
                occur naturally but can lead to cancer or tumors if not repaired
                by your cells.
              </p>
              <p>
                4. Almost two-thirds of Americans living with Alzheimer's
                disease are women. But the caffeine in two cups of coffee may
                provide significant protection against developing the condition.
                In fact, researchers found that women age 65 and older who drank
                two to three cups of coffee a day were less likely to develop
                dementia in general.

              <h3>Coffee Varieties!</h3>
              <p>
                1. Typica is one of two parent varieties of coffee cultivars and
                has been selectively bred for more than 500 years.The Typica
                variety is sweet, mild, and approachable. Notes of chocolate and
                nut take center stage, complemented by hints of spice. Typica's
                acidity is mild and balanced, conjuring dried fruit and dark
                stone fruit, such as black cherry and plum.
              </p>

              <p>
                2.Bourbon - Named for an island off the coast of Madagascar, is
                one of the world's most culturally and genetically important
                arabica varieties. Bourbon is a parent of numerous other coffee
                varieties. Bourbon delivers brown sugar-like sweetness, fruit
                notes like cherry and peach, and a round body.
              </p>

              <p>
                3. Caturra is a genetic mutation of Bourbon, first identified
                outside of a village called Caturra in Brazil. This variety was
                selected and cultivated for its smaller plant size and higher
                level of production compared to Bourbon. Caturra tastes similar
                to Bourbon, but is somewhat brighter.
