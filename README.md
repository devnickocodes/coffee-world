# __Coffee World - Portfolio Project 1__
Coffee World is a website that provides coffee lovers, enthusiasts and people who are just beginning their journey with coffee, different interesting facts about it. The website also provides a short description of some of the most popular types of coffee drinks, as well as a gallery with all kinds of images of coffees, the website also allows the user to sign up or log in to the website if they already have an existing account.

The objective for this project is to use purely HTML and CSS to create a static, very accesible and responsive website, where it is easy for the user to find their way around.

### __Colour Scheme__


I chose the color scheme myself bearing in mind UI and UX. I am using [Coolors.co](https://github.com/devnickocodes/coffee-world/blob/main/documentation/coolors-color-scheme.png) to easily display the color scheme of the website.
