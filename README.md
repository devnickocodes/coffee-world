# __Coffee World - Portfolio Project 1__
Coffee World is a website that provides coffee lovers, enthusiasts and people who are just beginning their journey with coffee, different interesting facts about it. The website also provides a short description of some of the most popular types of coffee drinks, as well as a gallery with all kinds of images of coffees, the website also allows the user to sign up or log in to the website if they already have an existing account.

The objective for this project is to use purely HTML and CSS to create a static, very accesible and responsive website, where it is easy for the user to find their way around.

### __Colour Scheme__


I chose the color scheme myself bearing in mind UI and UX. I am using [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/613613-997950-5c2c06-6e4e24-ebbdbd-997950-f0e7e7) to easily display the color scheme of the website.

### __Typography__

I imported the fonts for the website from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=montserrat
) and I used the Montserrat font as the main font for the website and the Oxygen font for the headings.

## __Features__ 

### __Common Elements__

The following elements are seen on every page of the website while the user is going through it.

- __Logo and Navigation Bar__
    - The logo and navigation bar are shown on all of the pages across the website. They both have been made with having optimal responsiveness in mind. The name of the website as well as the coffee cup icon lead to the homepage when clicked and each link in the navigational bar leads to its relevant social page.

- __Favicon__
    - The favicon of the browser tab makes the whole website cohesive and it represents the idea of the website.
