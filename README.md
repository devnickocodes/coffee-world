### __Colour Scheme__


I chose the color scheme myself bearing in mind UI and UX. I am using [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/613613-997950-5c2c06-6e4e24-ebbdbd-997950-f0e7e7) to easily display the color scheme of the website.

### __Typography__

I imported the fonts for the website from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=montserrat
) and I used the Montserrat font as the main font for the website and the Oxygen font for the headings.

## __Features__ 

### __Common Elements__

The following elements are seen on every page of the website while the user is going through it.

- __Logo and Navigation Bar__
    - The logo and navigation bar are shown on all of the pages across the website. They both have been made with having optimal responsiveness in mind. The name of the website as well as the coffee cup icon lead to the homepage when clicked and each link in the navigational bar leads to its relevant social page.

- __Favicon__
    - The favicon of the browser tab makes the whole website cohesive and it represents the idea of the website.

- __Coffee Types Containers__

The containers for each of the coffe types consist of an image on the top half of the container followed by the name of the drink and a short desrciption of the specific coffee type. Underneath the description there is a link that takes the user to the full article of that coffee type. The containers are responsive and there are nine coffee types displayed in three columns with three rows on bigger screens and as the screen gets smaller they are displayed in two columns and finally one column.
