# __Coffee World - Portfolio Project 1__

Coffee World is a website that provides coffee lovers, enthusiasts and people who are just beginning their journey with coffee, different interesting facts about it. The website also provides a short description of some of the most popular types of coffee drinks, as well as a gallery with all kinds of images of coffees, the website also allows the user to sign up or log in to the website if they already have an existing account.

The objective for this project is to use purely HTML and CSS to create a static, very accesible and responsive website, where it is easy for the user to find their way around.

### __Colour Scheme__

I chose the color scheme myself bearing in mind UI and UX. I am using [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/613613-997950-5c2c06-6e4e24-ebbdbd-997950-f0e7e7) to easily display the color scheme of the website.

### __Typography__

I imported the fonts for the website from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=montserrat
) and I used the Montserrat font as the main font for the website and the Oxygen font for the headings.

## __Features__

### __Common Elements__

The following elements are seen on every page of the website while the user is going through it.

- __Logo and Navigation Bar__
- The logo and navigation bar are shown on all of the pages across the website. They both have been made with having optimal responsiveness in mind. The name of the website as well as the coffee cup icon lead to the homepage when clicked and each link in the navigational bar leads to its relevant social page.

- __Favicon__
- The favicon of the browser tab makes the whole website cohesive and it represents the idea of the website.

- __The Footer__
- The footer is displayed on the bottom of every page of the website. It includes social media links as well as a link to the GitHub website.

- __Interesting Facts__
- The interesting facts containers display four different interesting facts two on each row on bigger screens and one on each row on smaller screens that include - top three countries that drink the most coffee, the most expensive coffee in the world, health benefits of coffee and coffee varieties. In each one of the containers there is a background image and a background color behind the text for contrast and easy readability.

### __Coffee Types Page__

On this page the user can find a short description for some of the most popular coffee types that are consumed on a daily basis.

- __Coffee Types Containers__

The containers for each of the coffe types consist of an image on the top half of the container followed by the name of the drink and a short desrciption of the specific coffee type. Underneath the description there is a link that takes the user to the full article of that coffee type. The containers are responsive and there are nine coffee types displayed in three columns with three rows on bigger screens and as the screen gets smaller they are displayed in two columns and finally one column.

### __Gallery Page__

On this page the user can find a gallery consisting of all kinds of images that are related to coffee. The gallery is displayed using Masonry layout as this layout gives an aesthetic touch to the gallery and the page itself. It is also responsive and on bigger screens there are three columns that go to two and finally one as the screen size gets smaller.

### __Sign Up Page__

On this page the user can create their own personal account for the website that would allow them to share their own photos in the gallery, a button option to like or dislike. Bellow the information that the user needs to type in, in order for their account to be created there is an option for existing users that already have an account that takes them to the log in page.
